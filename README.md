# macOSLAPS

LAPS solution for macOS managed with Jamf

v2.2.2 now uploaded and available. Check the [Change log](https://github.com/PezzaD84/macOSLAPS/blob/main/Change%20Log) for changes and improvments.

Please see the [Wiki page](https://github.com/PezzaD84/macOSLAPS/wiki) for setting up LAPS for macOS on your Jamf instance. The LAPS solution creates the local admin account, randomises and encodes the password, uploads the encoded password to Jamf and then a self service app is used to decode and show the local admin password to your engineers.

The LAPS Script also includes the ability to redirect notifications to Slack using the WebHooks app. (Thanks Martijn for the idea https://github.com/ons-mart)

To help encode your API credentials there is a small script in this git [Encode API Credentials](https://github.com/PezzaD84/macOSLAPS/blob/main/Encode%20API%20Credentials)

LAPS v2 uses Swift Dialog the original project can be found here [Swift Dialog](https://github.com/bartreardon/swiftDialog)
All credit for swift Dialog goes to the owner and creator please support their project.
